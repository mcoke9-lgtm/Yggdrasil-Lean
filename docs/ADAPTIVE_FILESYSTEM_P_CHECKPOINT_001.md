# Adaptive Filesystem `p` Checkpoint 001

**Updated:** 2026-10-27  
**Active branch:** `review-history-identity-read-evidence-001`  
**Repository:** `mcoke9-lgtm/Yggdrasil-Lean`

## 1. Where we've been

The work developed from review-history resolution and parent-graph auditing into a serialized graph-input certificate, a gated graph consumer, and a read-only snapshot test against the Airtable pilot. A new chat does not imply a new project branch; recover this branch from repository/project records before continuing.

## 2. What we've done

- Moved raw graph resolver functions to `reference-model/review-history-resolver.internal.mjs`; the public facade no longer exports them.
- Made `verified-graph-consumer.mjs` own the analysis operation instead of accepting a caller-supplied analyzer callback.
- Added a serialized graph artifact verifier that checks mapping consistency and recomputes the graph payload digest.
- Refreshed the checked-in 10-record pilot snapshot after a read-only Airtable read showed that AF-PILOT-007 has no parent reference.
- Added structured `yggdrasil-source-read-evidence-v1` validation in `graph-input-certificate.mjs`. It checks matching source-read identity and digest, returned count, reported total, pagination completion, non-empty scope, and digest algorithm label.
- Added `buildSourceReadEvidenceManifest`, which computes a SHA-256 digest over a canonical projection of record IDs and parent references, sorted by record ID.
- Added `reference-model/source-read-adapter.mjs` with `adaptCompleteSourceRead`: validates source read ID, explicit scope, records, reported total, and null next cursor before deriving the manifest and graph certificate.
- Added tests for adapter success, count mismatch, incomplete pagination, malformed scope, inconsistent evidence counts, digest mismatch, order-invariant digest, and changed-parent digest sensitivity.
- Updated `docs/GRAPH_ANALYSIS_GATE_BYPASS_AUDIT_001.md` with the evidence-manifest design and limitations.

## 3. What we've learned

- A graph digest binds a graph payload; it does not prove source authenticity or completeness.
- A bare boolean completeness attestation is weak. A structured manifest improves auditability and consistency checks.
- A self-consistent manifest is still forgeable if a caller can author it. Trusted provenance requires a source adapter or another independently verifiable source of evidence.
- The checked-in snapshot test exercises the gate against a recorded snapshot, not a live Airtable query inside CI.
- The internal module is protected by architecture convention and CI checks, not JavaScript-enforced privacy.
- Lean compilation does not prove semantic equivalence with the JavaScript resolver or establish source completeness.

## 4. Current state

**Implemented and CI-verified** on commit `724a5420aa92fbee678ae4ddabbf31dbbf8a3fcf`.

- Resolver tests: [passed](https://github.com/mcoke9-lgtm/Yggdrasil-Lean/actions/runs/40493008567).
- Lean build: [passed](https://github.com/mcoke9-lgtm/Yggdrasil-Lean/actions/runs/40493008614).

The read-only Airtable pilot was not mutated. The most recent observed source read returned 10 records, reported total 10, and no next-page cursor. The graph projection had 10 vertices and 8 edges and reported no cycle.

## 5. Plan

1. **Next:** design a trusted source-adapter boundary that constructs the evidence manifest from actual connector results and binds the exact source scope, pagination state, record count, and canonical source projection digest.
2. Add a live-or-recorded provenance test proving the manifest was emitted by the adapter, not assembled by an arbitrary caller.
3. Keep live connector integration separate from fixture-based CI claims. Do not mutate the Airtable pilot.
4. Re-audit gate bypass paths and update this checkpoint with exact commit and CI results.
5. Investigate whether source identity and digest can be independently verified against connector-returned data at the boundary.
6. Only then consider production wiring; do not equate the reference model with production enforcement.

## 6. Integrity and persistence

- **Source of truth:** this GitHub repository and the Airtable pilot Records table; the pilot is disposable, not the canonical archive.
- **Checkpoint persistence:** this file is intended as a durable `p` summary and is committed to the active branch.
- **Evidence status:** the live read evidence is observational; the checked-in fixture is not a live CI integration.
- **Remaining uncertainty:** source-read manifest authenticity, independently established source completeness, and JS/Lean semantic equivalence are unresolved.
- **Six-Part Integrity Check:** count = 6; roles = history, actions, learning, state, plan, persistence; distinguish implemented from CI-verified; recheck after every material change.
